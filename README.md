# MudraKosh

***Making more possible.***

India is considered to be the second most unbanked nation with a statistic of 190 million unbanked adults. Due to this, and the added disadvantage of inability to offer any collateral, many individuals are unable to access loans from trustable sources at reasonable interest and sort to unreliable credit source.
Therefore, to eliminate these and consequent problems, MudraKosh aims to provide:
* Easy and quick lending accessibility without the need for banks or collateral
* 100% digital process
* Reasonable interest rates for overall profit of all parties involved
* Ensured security at all stages
## What is MudraKosh?
* A proposal for a revolutionary system to deliver fast loans to individuals/MSMEs who are part of any industrial domain, including horticulture, textile, wood, etc.
* The system acts as a direct mediator between the borrowers and lenders:
  * Borrowers apply for loan on the platform
  * MudraKosh connects with potential lenders to the borrowers and directs the creditflow in fractions (microcredit scheme)
* **Borrowers**: Individuals/MSMEs in need of loans
* **Lenders**: Large-scale organizations/interested 3rd parties looking for profitable and secure investments with assured returns
* Our additional feature also helps provide financial literacy to the targeted audience

At the same time, financial literacy will provide in-depth knowledge of financial education and strategies that are crucial for financial growth and success.*

## Features that are good to have
* We can use **blockchains** to create a centralized joint register of transaction that is extremely secured. This can eventually lead to no data redundancy and reduce chances of forging as all transactions are available.
* We can at later stage **provide deposit services** ourselves and manage financial activities.
* We can make **mobile application** of MudraKosh accessible to all.

## Constraints
> Our limitations provide us a scope for improvement.

Technical and practical constraints to be overcome:
* Lack of sufficient financial support for outreach to the lower class
* Even after applying maximum security measures, occurrence of fraud is still possible and to be expected 

## Known Issues
In order to implement the system we are taking some assumption:
* Readiness of industries to invest in the progress of the disadvantaged
* Local government aid and cooperation available for smooth implementation (panchayat/ local leaders)

The lack of these services will be an issue in the implementation.

## Solution Implementation and Effectiveness
The system is implementable on a large scale given that every transaction takes place digitally.
Problems arise if the assumptions are not satisfied. These can be solved by external financial aid provided by investors of MudraKosh.
Without the need for any physical presence, enriched by ML, the system can be launched to consumers at the earliest.

Provided that all parties involved are willing to work under lawful jurisdiction, the solution can be implemented effectively.
We will successfully be able to provide loans and assistance services to those in need at a faster pace than the current system.
We will essentially be able to solve every problem we set out to mitigate.
## Social Impact
Our solution will ultimately impact MSMEs and people without assets to get a secure and sufficient loan via digitalised platform, and help them in growing and industrializing rural and backward areas thereby reducing regional imbalance assuring more equitable distribution of national income and wealth, along with providing financial literacy which will inturn make the whole process more dependable.
